## Columns Explanation

The following columns have been removed from the dataset: station, gust, peak_wind_drct

The station column was removed because it contains non-numerical data, which is also not useful for modelling purposes.

The gust and peak_wind_drct columns only contain null values, which makes it impossible to use them for this analysis.
